<br>As of this writing, buff163 sits at number six on the csgo skins Pulse leaderboard. It hosts an aggregate of $3.69 billion of collateralized assets. However the biggest competitor buff163 is fifth on the list and holds $3.97 billion.
<br>
<br>
<br>The DEX has a large part of its success to savvy and strategic thinking. Through introducing superior features to their rivals, buff163 reached more than $1.6 billion in liquid assets in just one month. But since the features were only temporary as was the platform's popularity. Certain controversies did not aid either and buff163 changed from being csgo skins's top project to the most unpopular.
<br>
<br>
<br>This meant that nobody wanted to alter this protocol over the course of months. It wasn't until the new developers started developing buff163 to make the swap more secure that it was able to gain the trust of the community.
<br>
<br>
<br>buff163 Marketplace buff163 Marketplace allows users to swap any CS:GO, DOTA 2 Skins token for any other token CS:GO, DOTA 2 Skins using automatic liquidity pools. The Swap page is an example. It was only when new developers started developing buff163 when the swap was able to win back the trust of the community.&nbsp;</p>
